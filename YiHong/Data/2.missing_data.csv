Description Overview: As per PSC report: Def 2 from February 2022 PSC re: forward liferaft operating instruction not complied as per PSC report requirement. Nature of defect: Not as required. Convention reference: SOLAS, Grounds for detention: No.

Immediate Causes: Failure to Follow Procedure / Instruction
Introduction: This deficiency was recorded by Himeji - Japan PSC (Tokyo MOU).
What happened: The Life raft is located in the center of breakwater with launching instruction above. The launching instruction should be readable in day and night, however there were no emergency lights in the location where Liferaft was installed - that was the deficiency raised in Japan.
How it happened / Rectification : The problem was solved in Feb-2022 by placing two more instructions, one of them on p/s and one on s/s close to rotatable emergency projectors for disembarkation. The Problem solved locally, but was not closed by Tokyo MoU. Rectification : Approved letter from Class was provided during follow-up AMSA Inspection.

Root Cause Analysis: Inadequate review instruction
As explained above

Corrective Action: Approved letter from Class was provided. Conducted Follow-up inspection in Townsville, QLD (Australia) / 30-Jan-2023 where rectification of all deficiencies verified / all codes downgraded to '10- rectified'

Preventive Action: Raising awareness among the crew through the Quarterly Safety Bulletin

Deficiency/Finding: Each incinerator subject to this paragraph shall be approved by the Administration, considering the standard specifics for shipboard incinerators developed by the organization. PSCO observed missing brick refractory.

Description Overview: UNKNOWN

Immediate Causes: UNKNOWN

Root Cause Analysis: The missing brick refractory in the incinerator may have occurred due to continuous exposure to high temperature and vibration, which could affect the condition of the bricks inside the incinerator. However, due to the location of the bricks under the stainless steel, the evaluation of the condition, such as one damaged brick, during routine inspection was overlooked.

Corrective Action: The missing brick refractory was replaced in the incinerator to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and standards. The maintenance report from the captain reflects the completion of the job.

Preventive Action: The ISM department issued a circular titled 'Condition of Incinerator Room,' addressing the evaluation of the incinerator's condition. A safety meeting must be convened to familiarize the crew with the new circular. Additionally, this matter will be inspected on board other vessels during internal audits.
